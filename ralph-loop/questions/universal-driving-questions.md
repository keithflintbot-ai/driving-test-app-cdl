A) Pump the brakes rapidly
B) Apply steady, firm pressure
C) Press lightly and release repeatedly
D) Only use the parking brake

**Correct Answer:** B) Apply steady, firm pressure
**Correct Index:** 2
**Explanation:** With ABS, apply firm, continuous pressure to the brake pedal - the system automatically prevents wheel lockup, so pumping is unnecessary and counterproductive.

---

## Question 39: Vehicle Operation

**When should you NOT use cruise control?**

A) On long highway trips
B) On straight roads
C) In slippery or wet conditions
D) During daylight hours

**Correct Answer:** C) In slippery or wet conditions

**Explanation:** Cruise control should not be used on wet, icy, or slippery roads because the system may cause wheel spin or prevent proper response to changing traction.

---

## Question 40: Vehicle Operation

**What is engine braking?**

A) Using your foot brake aggressively
B) Applying the parking brake while moving
C) Downshifting to use engine resistance to slow down
D) Turning off the engine to stop

**Correct Answer:** C) Downshifting to use engine resistance to slow down

---

## Question 41: Vehicle Operation

**When starting on an uphill slope, what helps prevent rolling backward?**

A) Shifting to neutral
B) Pressing the accelerator to the floor
C) Turning off the engine
D) Using the parking brake until you accelerate

---

## Question 42: Vehicle Operation

**What is the proper technique for entering a curve?**

A) Brake before the curve, not during it
B) Accelerate through the curve
C) Maintain constant heavy braking throughout
D) Speed up at the start of the curve

**Correct Answer:** A) Brake before the curve, not during it

---

## Question 43: Stopping Distance

**What are the two main components of total stopping distance?**

A) Reaction distance and braking distance
B) Speed and weight
C) Tire pressure and road type
D) Weather and visibility

**Correct Answer:** A) Reaction distance and braking distance

---

## Question 44: Stopping Distance

**How does doubling your speed affect your braking distance?**

A) It doubles the braking distance
B) It triples the braking distance
C) It has no effect
D) It quadruples the braking distance

**Correct Answer:** D) It quadruples the braking distance
**Correct Index:** 4
**Explanation:** Braking distance increases with the square of speed - if you double your speed, your braking distance becomes four times as long.

---

## Question 45: Stopping Distance

**What road condition increases stopping distance the most?**

A) Dry pavement
B) New asphalt
C) Icy or snowy roads
D) Gravel shoulders

**Correct Answer:** C) Icy or snowy roads
**Correct Index:** 3
**Explanation:** Ice and snow dramatically reduce tire traction, which can increase stopping distance by ten times or more compared to dry pavement.

---

## Question 46: Stopping Distance

**How does a heavier vehicle affect stopping distance?**

A) It decreases stopping distance
B) Weight has no effect on stopping distance
C) It increases stopping distance
D) It only affects uphill stopping

**Correct Answer:** C) It increases stopping distance
**Correct Index:** 3
**Explanation:** Heavier vehicles have more momentum and require more braking force and distance to stop, especially when carrying passengers or cargo.

---

## Question 47: Stopping Distance

**Worn tires affect stopping distance by doing what?**

A) Improving grip on the road
B) Having no effect in dry conditions
C) Only affecting wet weather driving
D) Reducing the ability to grip the road

**Correct Answer:** D) Reducing the ability to grip the road
**Correct Index:** 4
**Explanation:** Worn tires have less tread depth, reducing their ability to channel water and grip the road, which increases stopping distance in all conditions.

---

## Question 48: Stopping Distance

**What is the purpose of the two-second rule?**

A) To time traffic light changes
B) To determine speed limits
C) To maintain a safe following distance
D) To measure reaction time

**Correct Answer:** C) To maintain a safe following distance
**Correct Index:** 3
**Explanation:** The two-second rule helps maintain safe following distance - watch the vehicle ahead pass a fixed point, then count at least two seconds before you reach that point.

---

## Question 49: Stopping Distance

**When should you increase your following distance beyond the standard rule?**

A) Only during rush hour
B) In bad weather, when following large vehicles, or when visibility is poor

---

## Question 50: Stopping Distance

**What happens to your reaction distance when you are fatigued?**

A) It decreases
B) It stays the same
C) It increases
D) It becomes more predictable

**Correct Answer:** C) It increases
**Correct Index:** 3
**Explanation:** Fatigue slows reaction time, meaning you travel farther before perceiving danger and beginning to brake, increasing your total stopping distance.

---

A) The driver on the left
B) The faster vehicle
C) The driver on the right

B) Drive in neutral to save fuel
C) Ride the clutch to slow down
D) Shift to a lower gear to control speed

**Correct Answer:** D) Shift to a lower gear to control speed
**Correct Index:** 4
**Explanation:** Use a lower gear on steep downgrades so engine braking helps control speed - continuous brake use can cause brake fade from overheating.

---

**What should you do when approaching a curve?**

A) Slow down before entering the curve
B) Maintain your speed throughout
C) Accelerate into the curve
D) Brake heavily in the middle of the curve

A) The right side
B) The left side
C) Either side is equally safe
D) Wait until the truck pulls over

**Correct Answer:** B) The left side
**Correct Index:** 2
**Explanation:** Pass trucks on the left where you are more visible - trucks have larger blind spots on the right side, making left-side passing safer.

---
